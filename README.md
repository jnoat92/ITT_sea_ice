# ITT: Irregular Tokens on Transformers

This is the code base for the paper *ITT: Long-range Spatial Dependencies for Sea Ice Semantic Segmentation*

Features:

- Combination of CNNs, transformers, and unsupervised segmentation to successfully classify ice and open water in SAR images. 

- Incorporation of local and global context to address non-stationary statistics, ensuring confident predictions and more detailed segmentation around boundaries.

- This method constitutes the first attempt to uniquely implement self-attention on tokens extracted from irregular, homogeneous, and multi-scale regions within the input image.

- The code includes the experimental protocols employing dual-polarized images from the RADARSAT-2 sensor.

## Dependencies
- All dependencies can be found in [create_virtualenv.sh](job_submission_computecanada/submit_scripts/create_virtualenv.sh)
- The MAGIC library python wrapper used to pre-compute homogeneous regions is not publicly available due to existing licensing conflicts that need to be addressed. Instead, any other unsupervised segmentation method can be used.

## Running the code

- The file [Main_Script_Executor.py](Codes/Main_Script_Executor.py) contains the commands to be executed for each experiment.
- This code was run on infrastructure provided by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada, that supports [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) for resource management. In case multiple GPUs are available to run the code, the [MULTIPLE GPU SETUP](https://github.com/jnoat92/ITT_sea_ice/blob/13ab3db8feef7a5ec478f37d1d94d440d5e4a54f/Codes/train_IRGS_trans_EndToEnd.py#L377) section will need to be modified if the hardware does not support SLURM.
